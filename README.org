* Intro
* Architecture
First "block finder" reads in the data set, and according to a predetermined pattern of inserting documents into the application, creates and inserts "blocks" of papers into the current chain.

Each block itself is a JSON object, that contains metrics as keys, and values as a greatest-to-least ordered list of papers according to that metric.

Each creation step then involved inserting new papers' metrics into the lists, while maintaining orderliness.

Finally, after all the blocks are created, the "init directories by block" method reads in the latest block, and recreates a file structure that mirrors the data in the block. Specifically, the first paper in a metric's list is clearly the greatest metric, so that paper would be linked to by the corresponding metric link in the root directory. Then, sub-directories are created for each unique conference, and according to the stored papers, sub-directories of years are created for the conferences. Each subdirectory has links to the paper represented by the metric 

* Conferences
IEEE on computer vision and pattern recognition
https://research.com/conference/cvpr-2022-ieeecvf-conference-on-computer-vision-and-pattern-recognition

NIPS: neural information processing systems
https://research.com/conference/neurips-2021-neural-information-processing-systems-nips

International joint conference on artificial intelligence
https://research.com/conference/ijcai-2021-international-joint-conference-on-artificial-intelligence-ijcai




* Implementation
overall, we choose a conf, year, etc to add stuff too. the existing papers are taken, all papers are sorted etc, and the metrics are recalced and overwrite the current metric place holder
ds will just be giant list or some shit
then when user finds their desired metric, will return link to doi


for history, will store which papers were inserted

* Metrics Used
| #  | Metric                                                      | API              | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The h-index is a number intended to represent both the productivity and the impact of a particular scientist or scholar, or a group of scientists or scholars (such as a departmental or research group). The h-index is calculated by counting the number of publications for which an author has been cited by other authors at least that same number of times.Â  For instance, an h-index of 17 means that the scientist has published at least 17 papers that have each been cited at least 17 times.Â  If the scientist's 18th most cited publication was cited only 10 times, the h-index would remain at 17.Â  If the scientist's 18th most cited publication was cited 18 or more times, the h-index would rise to 18. |
