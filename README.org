* Intro
This project was an introduction to distributed file systems and blockchain-based storage of data. Project allows users to insert groups of papers, at which point, metrics such as most citations in a conference are updated. Users can interact with these metrics, and can even see the historical changes of which paper corresponds to the highest metric.

To run:
#+begin_src
  git clone https://github.com/harshasomisetty/citation_chain
  cd citation_chain
  python block_finder.py
  python server.py
#+end_src

Then go to localhost:5000, and click around on conference links, year links, and select metrics to find the paper with the highest metric ranking in that group.
* Architecture
** Current Architecture
The overall data structure storing all the metrics is a list of lists. Essentially, an overarching list stores the metrics and list of conferences. Each list of conferences then store a list of overall metrics for the conference, and list of years. Each list of years stores overall metrics for the year, and a list of papers.

The process of inserting papers is as follows.

First, "block finder" reads in the dataset of papers as batches. The papers in these batches are inserted in the appropriate list, and the list metrics to be recalculated are marked.

Next, each marked year list's papers are gathered as a pandas df (the doi is references against the total list of papers, and the appropriate metrics are gathered), resorted, and the top paper for each metric is stored in the metric section of the year. This process is repeated for the conference (all the papers across all the conferences' years are gathered and metrics are collected), and for the entire data base (all papers across all conferences are gathered and metrics collected). Each new batch insertion thus increases the block size, and for historical purposes, all the blocks are stored in a json object in "blockspace.json"

Finally, the frontend reads the latest block, and displays all possible conferences and years in conferences. All the possible metrics are shown, and each click to a metric reads the block and accesses the appropriate metric for either metrics per entire data set, metrics per conference, and metrics per year in conference.
** Previous architecture
Previously, the top papers only were stored, and a makeshift filesystem was constructed after reading the block.

First “block finder” reads in the data set, and according to a predetermined pattern of inserting documents into the application, creates and inserts “blocks” of papers into the current chain.

Each block itself is a JSON object, that contains metrics as keys, and values as a greatest-to-least ordered list of papers according to that metric.

Each creation step then involved inserting new papers’ metrics into the lists, while maintaining orderliness.

Finally, after all the blocks are created, the “init directories by block” method reads in the latest block, and recreates a file structure that mirrors the data in the block. Specifically, the first paper in a metric’s list is clearly the greatest metric, so that paper would be linked to by the corresponding metric link in the root directory. Then, sub-directories are created for each unique conference, and according to the stored papers, sub-directories of years are created for the conferences. Each subdirectory has links to the paper represented by the metric.

* Collection of Research Paper Metrics
** APIs used for collecting DOIs:
There are many research papers related to different domains. But for our project we are considering only a limited number of conference papers related to the Computer Science field. The efficient way to distinguish between research papers is the DOI. A DOI, or Digital Object Identifier, is a string of numbers, letters and symbols used to uniquely identify an article or document, and to provide it with a permanent web address (URL). A DOI will help the reader easily locate a document from the citation. Think of it like a Social Security number for the article you're citing — it will always refer to that article, and only that one. While a web address (URL) might change, the DOI will never change. 
So the first step in our project is to collect a list of DOIs which we want to show on our webpage and build a ranking system on those dataset. There are numerous ways to get a list of DOIs from the internet, but we used two specific APIs to automatically populate the DOI array.
1. IEEE provides us with the API which can be used to Query and retrieve metadata records including abstracts for more than 5 million documents in IEEE Xplore® including Journals, Conference Proceedings, Books, Courses and Standards. So we used the API to retrieve a list of DOIs with a few keywords as the search parameters.  For example , if you need a list of 100 DOIs which are related to the Computer Vision field from the years 2015 to 2017, we can write a simple query  request="https://ieeexploreapi.ieee.org/api/v1/search/articles?index_terms=software&max_records=100&start_year=2015&end_year=2021&start_record=1&apikey=’yourapikey’ " x=requests.get(request). Now x has the list of DOIs along with their information.

2. Scopus also provides us with a huge database of research papers information. They have a large number of research papers related to many different fields. We can simply download the list of papers DOI for different conferences for different years which is in the form of a csv file. Using pandas we convert that into a dataframe and only extract the DOI column and append to our original list of DOIs.

** APIs used to collect metrics
Now that we have a list of DOIs, we can extract a lot of information about the papers using DOI as an index which distinguishes one paper from another. We classified different information related to a research paper to be a metric for our ranking system. There are different APIs available to achieve this task:
- Arxiv	https://arxiv.org/help/api/index
- Crossref https://github.com/fabiobatalha/crossrefapi
- Springer https://dev.springernature.com/example-metadata-response
- SemanticScholar https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api
- Scopus https://dev.elsevier.com/api_docs.html
- IEEE  https://developer.ieee.org/docs
But for our specific use case we used Scopus and Semantic Scholar APIs which gave us an almost consistent dataset. 
1. Scopus also provides us with a Python-based API-Wrapper to access Scopus database: pybliometrics. pybliometrics is an easy to use Python library to pull, cache and extract data from the Scopus database. More information available here : https://pybliometrics.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ . pybliometrics provides one class per Scopus API Access Point. We used classes like:
    - scopus.AbstractRetrieval([identifier, …]) -  Interaction with the Abstract Retrieval API.
    - scopus.AffiliationRetrieval(aff_id[, …]) - Interaction with the Affiliation Retrieval API.
    - scopus.AuthorRetrieval(author_id[, refresh, …]) - Interaction with the Author Retrieval API. 
    AbstractRetrieval is used to extract all the information regarding the research paper. 
    AffiliationRetrieval is used to extract all the information about the affiliations which are related to the research paper. AuthorRetrieval is used to extract all 
    the information about the authors from the research paper. 
2. Semantic Scholar also  provides the RESTful Semantic Scholar Academic Graph (S2AG) API as a service to the global research community. The API is a reliable on-demand source of data about authors, papers, citations, venues, and more that allows linking directly to the corresponding page on semanticscholar.org for more information. Paper and author lookup are available from their Academic Graph service. More information available here : 
https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api. 
The /paper/search endpoint will perform a keyword search for papers. 
Eg: http://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=literature+graph
There is a python library available on GitHub that aims to retrieve data from Semantic Scholar API. https://github.com/danielnsilva/semanticscholar
It programmatically accesses paper and author data from the API.

|  9 | hIndexAuthors               | Scopus           |   Sum of all the h index of authors from that research paper. The h-index is a number intended to represent both the productivity and the impact of a particular scientist or scholar, or a group of scientists or scholars (such as a departmental or research group). The h-index is calculated by counting the number of publications for which an author has been cited by other authors at least that same number of times.  For instance, an h-index of 17 means that the scientist has published at least 17 papers that have each been cited at least 17 times.  If the scientist's 18th most cited publication was cited only 10 times, the h-index would remain at 17.  If the scientist's 18th most cited publication was cited 18 or more times, the h-index would rise to 18. |

** Page Rank Algorithm
Thousands of research papers are published every year and these papers span various fields of research. For a new researcher, it becomes a very difficult task to go through the entire repository of research papers in order to determine the important ones. The term important is subjective but it can be assured that a research paper that is popular will be important in most cases. There can be several ways of determining whether a research paper is important depending on the field of work, conference of publication, etc. Research papers cite other research papers from which they derive inspiration and there exists a well connected graph structure among the network of research papers. The importance of a research paper is directly proportional to the number of research papers that cite it. We have used this concept in our algorithm.
We will build the citation network defined as a graph, with each research paper representing a node and the citations representing the edges in the graph, the edges being directed ones, directed from the citing node to the cited node. The first step uses paper citations and creates a data structure mapping each paper to its inlinks and outlinks. The next step is to implement the iterative PageRank algorithm. The iterative PageRank algorithm starts with initializing all the candidates to a constant value, generally unity and then it iteratively modifies each candidate's score depending on the score of the candidates that point towards it. It stops when all the candidate scores converge, i.e. become constant. The PageRank algorithm is based on the fact that the quality of a node is equivalent to the summation of the qualities of the nodes that point to it. In this case, quality refers to the score of the research paper.
