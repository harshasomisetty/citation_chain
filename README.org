* Intro
This project was an introduction to distributed file systems and blockchain-based storage of data. Project allows users to insert groups of papers, at which point, metrics such as most citations in a conference are updated. Users can interact with these metrics, and can even see the historical changes of which paper corresponds to the highest metric.

To run:
#+begin_src
  git clone https://github.com/harshasomisetty/citation_chain
  cd citation_chain
  python block_finder.py
  python server.py
#+end_src

Then go to localhost:5000, and click around on conference links, year links, and select metrics to find the paper with the highest metric ranking in that group.
* Architecture
** Current Architecture
The overall data structure storing all the metrics is a list of lists. Essentially, an overarching list stores the metrics and list of conferences. Each list of conferences then store a list of overall metrics for the conference, and list of years. Each list of years stores overall metrics for the year, and a list of papers.

The process of inserting papers is as follows.

First, "block finder" reads in the dataset of papers as batches. The papers in these batches are inserted in the appropriate list, and the list metrics to be recalculated are marked.

Next, each marked year list's papers are gathered as a pandas df (the doi is references against the total list of papers, and the appropriate metrics are gathered), resorted, and the top paper for each metric is stored in the metric section of the year. This process is repeated for the conference (all the papers across all the conferences' years are gathered and metrics are collected), and for the entire data base (all papers across all conferences are gathered and metrics collected). Each new batch insertion thus increases the block size, and for historical purposes, all the blocks are stored in a json object in "blockspace.json"

Finally, the frontend reads the latest block, and displays all possible conferences and years in conferences. All the possible metrics are shown, and each click to a metric reads the block and accesses the appropriate metric for either metrics per entire data set, metrics per conference, and metrics per year in conference.
** Previous architecture
Previously, the top papers only were stored, and a makeshift filesystem was constructed after reading the block.

First “block finder” reads in the data set, and according to a predetermined pattern of inserting documents into the application, creates and inserts “blocks” of papers into the current chain.

Each block itself is a JSON object, that contains metrics as keys, and values as a greatest-to-least ordered list of papers according to that metric.

Each creation step then involved inserting new papers’ metrics into the lists, while maintaining orderliness.

Finally, after all the blocks are created, the “init directories by block” method reads in the latest block, and recreates a file structure that mirrors the data in the block. Specifically, the first paper in a metric’s list is clearly the greatest metric, so that paper would be linked to by the corresponding metric link in the root directory. Then, sub-directories are created for each unique conference, and according to the stored papers, sub-directories of years are created for the conferences. Each subdirectory has links to the paper represented by the metric.

|  9 | hIndexAuthors               | Scopus           |   Sum of all the h index of authors from that research paper. The h-index is a number intended to represent both the productivity and the impact of a particular scientist or scholar, or a group of scientists or scholars (such as a departmental or research group). The h-index is calculated by counting the number of publications for which an author has been cited by other authors at least that same number of times.  For instance, an h-index of 17 means that the scientist has published at least 17 papers that have each been cited at least 17 times.  If the scientist's 18th most cited publication was cited only 10 times, the h-index would remain at 17.  If the scientist's 18th most cited publication was cited 18 or more times, the h-index would rise to 18. |
